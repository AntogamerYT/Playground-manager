# Playgrounds Manager
Hello there fellow programmer!

This is the [Bot Playgrounds](https://discord.gg/XrQ4DTJ39t)' Discord Bot! You can use the code for everything you want and you can also don't credit us (even if it would be nice :D).
# Selfhosting the bot
It's a very easy process!

Download the code or clone the repo with git, put everything in a folder, do `npm install`, fill the .env and as the last command: `node .` (make sure to have node 16 or above, you can check your version with `node -v`)

NOTE: If you want the role menu part remember to change the guild ids, role ids and channel ids in `send.js`, `/events/buttons` and also in `/events/buttons/rr`!

tip: You can make the bot start up at server boot with `pm2` and its `pm2 startup` feature!
